# Huizhou Ancient City | How Three Centuries of Merchant Wealth Were Preserved

Walking into Huizhou Ancient City, the answer is rarely written on people’s faces. It is embedded instead in the grain of whitewashed walls and dark-tiled roofs.

At six in the morning, the surface of Hongcun’s South Lake has not yet been shattered by visitors’ voices. An elderly man pushes open a wooden door and, with a few soft sweeps, brushes the leaves that gathered overnight at the threshold into the narrow water channel outside his home. The sound of water is faint, but it flows steadily toward the edge of the village, carrying with it a sense of unmistakable direction.

In Qing-dynasty local gazetteers, this network of waterways threading through the village was called the “living water veins.” They served as firebreaks, but also symbolized the uninterrupted circulation of family fortune. Today, most visitors care only whether the reflections are photogenic. Three centuries ago, this gentle flow determined whether a family could endure through uncertain times.

A Land of Little Farmland, and the Birth of Long-Term Thinkers

Standing atop the walls of Huizhou Ancient City today, it is difficult to imagine that this quiet terrain was once among the most rational and finely calibrated regions in China’s commercial landscape. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Huizhou was described as “seven parts mountain, one part water, and one part farmland.” Scarcity pushed generations of men to leave home and enter commerce.

Unlike other merchant groups who rose through military power or political patronage, Huizhou merchants behaved more like committed long-term thinkers. They wrote trust into contracts, distributed risk across vast kinship networks, and defined the endpoint of wealth as something that could be passed down for three generations.

What modern visitors see are towering memorial arches and solemn ancestral halls. Historical records, however, reveal another reality. Account books from a Qing-era salt merchant show that as much as thirty percent of profits were mandatorily set aside as “clan assets,” reserved for famine relief, education, and legal disputes.

The contrast is striking: the wealthier the merchant group, the less urgency there was to consume wealth.

Hongcun: A Safety Protocol Designed in Water

Today, Hongcun is a paradise for photographers. Beyond the frame, however, it functions like a risk management system that has been running for centuries. South Lake serves as a buffer, Moon Pond as a regulator, and the water lanes as capillaries reaching every household. In the event of a fire, the village’s water flow could be rapidly redirected.

Scholars comparing Hongcun with Song-dynasty settlement remains have noted that its water system is, in essence, a “public safety protocol” embedded directly into geography.

Ancient people used water to manage uncertainty. Modern society relies on insurance and financial instruments. The underlying logic has not changed—only the medium has.

Xidi: Turning Wealth to Silent Mode

If Hongcun feels gentle, Xidi reads like an open genealogy, every line infused with restraint. The inscription “Lü Fu Lü Gui” carved into its memorial arches is not merely a blessing, but a warning: prosperity must remain within the boundaries of rules.

In a Qing-era merchant’s family letter, I encountered a single line that captures this ethic precisely: “Wealth may be dispersed, but reputation must not be damaged.”

At dusk, as shadows stretch across Xidi’s lanes, one detail becomes unmistakable. The most exquisite residences are often hidden at the deepest, least conspicuous corners, their gatehouses deliberately kept low. Here, wealth has been turned down to a whisper.

When City Walking Meets Huizhou Logic

After walking through Huizhou many times, I began to recognize a principle that transcends centuries. Whether among Huizhou merchants or contemporary creators, the core is never about ownership—it is about orchestration.

This realization reshaped my own approach to creation. During this Huizhou photography journey, I did not burden myself with permanent heavy assets. Some professional equipment was configured temporarily through the Lantuo rental platform—deploying the right tools at the right moment, completing the task, and allowing resources to continue circulating afterward.

What matters is not how much you possess, but how much you can mobilize when it counts.

On the day I left Huizhou, rain fell again. Water slipped from the eaves into the channels, flowing quietly toward the distance, just as it had three hundred years ago. When we press the shutter in Hongcun or Xidi, we are participating in a far longer chain of time.

What truly survives history is never the scenery itself, but the order and restraint hidden beneath it.
