I treat images as a form of long-term notes.
Through the lens, I record the textures of cities and landscapes; through words, I give them a structure that can continue to grow.

This is not a one-off project, nor a portfolio built for completion.
It is an archive in constant accumulation:
photographs serve as entry points, text forms the spine.
Between long walks and vast landscapes, it preserves what matters more than destinations—personal solitude, rhythm, and states of mind.

What you see here is the trace of more than a decade of walking, pausing, and looking back.
These works do not seek immediate response; they resemble memories slowly taking shape—about how the world is seen, and how I have gradually become myself over time.
